	<h1>Filtering by Selection</h1>
	<p>This tutorial will introduce you to some techniques for filtering a network by selection. You will learn to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select a set of nodes based on node degree and attribute</li>
        <li>Create a subnetwork based on selected nodes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For this tutorial, we will use data from the <a href="https://string-db.org/" target="_blank">STRING database.</a></p>

<h1>Selecting nodes based on degree</h1>
    <p>Every node in a network has a <b>Degree</b> property, which corresponds to the number of edges connecting the node to other nodes, either as a target or source. Filtering based on node degree is a useful way to remove nodes with too few or too many connections.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on the <b>Select</b> tab of the <b>Control Panel</b>.</li>
        <li>Click on the drop-down to the right and select <b>Create New Filter</b>. Enter a name for your filter, for example "node degree".</li>
        <li>Click the + (add) button and select <b>Degree Filter</b>.</li>
        <li>Leave the default selections for the two drop-downs (<b>In + Out</b> and <b>in</b>), and adjust the slider to include nodes with degree between 3 and 50. This will select all nodes with degree 3 or more.</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Filtering the network for high-confidence interactions</h1>
    <p>The interactions in your network have evidence from varying sources: high-confidence yeast two-hybrid interactions(LacZ4) and low-confidence yeast two-hybrid interactions(SD4), coAP and GST pull-down interactions (GST_PullDown), and supporting evidence of interaction reported in literature. Verify this by examining the edge types in the <b>Edge Table</b>. Let's use Cytoscape's filters to view only interactions from high-confidence yeast two-hybrid interactions(LacZ4) experiments.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on the <b>Select</b> tab of the <b>Control Panel</b>.</li>
        <li>Click on the drop-down to the right and select <b>Create New Filter</b>. Enter a name for your filter, for example "high-confidence".</li>
        <li>Click the + (add) button and select <b>Column Filter</b>. In the <b>Choose column...</b> drop-down, select "Edge:interaction".</li>
        <li>In the second drop-down, select "is" and type "LacZ4" in the text box.</li>
        <input type="button" class="btn btn-primary" onclick="cybrowser.executeCyCommand('network select edgeList=interaction:LacZ4');" value="Select LacZ4 interactions"/>

<p>The filter will be automatically applied. At the bottom of the <b>Select</b> tab, you can see how many edges/nodes where selected. A set of 59 nodes have been selected in your network. The main component of your network should now look like this, notice the yellow highlighted selected nodes:</p>

<h1>Creating a subnetwork from a selection</h1>
    <p>We can now create a new network, or subnetwork, from our selected set of nodes.</p>
<ul>
    <li>With the 59 nodes still selected, go to <b>New &rarr; Network &rarr; From selected nodes, all edges</b>.</li>
    <li>The new network will look similar to this:</li>

    <h1>Selecting nodes based on attributes</h1>
    <p>To further filter the network, we can prune out nodes with low <b>disease score</b>. The disease score comes from STRING and indicates the strength of the association to the disease queried. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on the <b>Select</b> tab of the <b>Control Panel</b>.</li>
        <li>Click on the drop-down to the right and select <b>Create New Filter</b>. Enter a name for your filter, for example "disease score".</li>
        <li>Click the + (add) button and select <b>Column Filter</b>. In the <b>Choose column...</b> drop-down, select <b>Node: disease score</b>.</li>
        <li>In the selection slider, select scores between 4.5 and 5.</li>
        <li>Again, select <b>New &rarr; Network &rarr; From selected nodes</b>, all edges.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
    
<!--
<div class="cybrowser">
<ul>
    <li>At this point, only the relevant edges are selected. To also select the connected nodes, go to <b>Select &rarr; Nodes &rarr; Nodes connected by selected edges.</b></li>
    <input type="button" class="btn btn-primary" onclick="cybrowser.executeCyCommand('network select firstNeighbors=any');" value="Select neighboring nodes"/>
    <li>Create a new network from the selection under <b>File &rarr; New &rarr; Network &rarr; From selected nodes, selected edges</b>.

    <p>The final network contains much fewer nodes, but they are the most connected and those most highly associated with disease. If you examine the network you can see several well-known breast cancer oncogenes, for example <highlight>BRCA1</highlight> and <highlight>PTEN</highlight>.</p>

<h1>Choosing nodes based on adjacent nodes</h1>
    <p>It is sometimes useful to select a node or edge based on properties of the nodes it connects to, as opposed to the properties of the node or an edge itself. For the sake of illustration, the STELZL data has a column tagging a node as "suspicious", as judged from analysis outside of Cytoscape. In this tutorial, we will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify all non-suspicious nodes and any nodes they connect to.</li>
        <li>Remove any suspicious nodes that are connected to less than 5 nodes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Remove sparsley connected suspicious nodes</h2>
    <p>We now have a network that includes both types of nodes. We will now create a new filter to remove all suspicious nodes that connect to fewer than five nodes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the <b>Select</b> tab, create a new filter and name it "Eliminate sparse suspicious nodes".</li>
        <li>Add a <b>Column Filter</b> for "Node:Suspicious" and choose "true".</li>
        <li>Add a <b>Degree Filter</b>. Set the range to between 0 and 4.</li>
        <li>To remove the selected nodes, select <b>Edit &rarr; Delete Selected Nodes and Edges...</b>.</li>
        <li>Finally, we need to remove any unconnected nodes that remain after the filters. Setup a <b>Degree Filter</b> with a range from 0 to 0. This selects all unconnected nodes. Delete the selected nodes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The new network has only non-suspicious nodes and suspicious nodes that connect to 5 or more nodes.</p>

    <h1>Editing</h1>
    <p>Sometimes it can be very useful to modify a network slightly, to add or remove nodes or edges. For instance, if you have prior knowledge of some biological process, you might want to add some nodes for proteins that you know are involved in a particular process, but that don't appear in your data set. <br />All network editing functions are available in a right-click context menu in the <b>Network View Window</b>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To add a node, right-click anywhere in the <b>Network View Window</b> and select <b>Add &rarr; Node</b>.</li>
        <li>Select the node with your mouse. In the <b>Node Table</b>, you should see a node with the shared name Node 1.</li>
        <li>Give your new node a name by clicking on the entry in the <b>Node Table</b>, and entering a name under the column <b>Official HUGO Symbol</b>.</li>
        <li>To add an edge to the node, right-click on the node and choose <b>Edit &rarr; Add Edge</b>. Drag the end of the newly created edge to another node in the network, and click to attach it.</li>
    </ul>
        <p>It is also possible to add nodes and interactions in sif format.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Locate the CPNE6 gene using the <b>Search</b> interface. Note the gene ID; 9362.</li>
        <li>We are going to add a known interaction between CPNE6 and GRB7 (Entrez ID 2886). With the CPNE6 gene in focus (not selected), right-click anywhere in the <b>Network View Window</b> and select <b>Add &rarr; Edge (and possibly Nodes) using SIF....</b></li>
        <li>In the <b>SIF Interpreter</b> dialog, enter "2886 interacts 9362" and click <b>OK</b>. You should see the new node with id 2886 connected to CPNE6.</li>
    </ul>
