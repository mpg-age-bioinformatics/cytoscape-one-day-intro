<h1>Network Layout</h1>
<p>Cytoscape includes many automatic layout algorithms, for organizing the network visually. All available layout algorithms are available in the <b>Layout</b> menu, including any layout aglorithms loaded by apps. This tutorial will describe how to apply a layout to your network, give a few examples of commonly used layout algorithms, and describe how layout algorithm parameters can be adjusted.</p>

<h2>Applying a Layout Algorithm</h2>
<div style="float:left;width:55%">
    <ul>
    <li>Load the <a href="https://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape-tutorials/protocols/data/galFiltered.sif"><i>galFiltered.sif</i> network</a>. This sample file is included with your Cytoscape installation, in the <b>sampleData</b> folder.</li>
    <li>To see the whole network, select <b>View  → Fit Content</b>.</li>
    <li>Go to <b>Layout</b> and select <b>Circular Layout</b>.</li>
    </ul><br /><br />
    <p class="fragment">
    The <highlight>circular</highlight> algorithm produces layouts that emphasize group and tree structures within a network. It partitions the network by analyzing its connectivity structure, and arranges the partitions as separate circles. The circles themselves are arranged in a radial tree layout fashion.</p>

<h2>Examples of Layout Algorithms</h2>
<p>The <highlight>Edge-weighted spring-embedded</highlight> layout is based on a “force-directed” paradigm as implemented by Kamada and Kawai (1988). Network nodes are treated like physical objects that repel each other, such as electrons. The connections between nodes are treated like metal springs attached to the pair of nodes. These springs repel or attract their end points according to a force function. The layout algorithm sets the positions of the nodes in a way that minimizes the sum of forces in the network.</p>

<p>The <highlight>Compound Spring Embedder (CoSE) layout</highlight> is based on the traditional force-directed layout algorithm with extensions to handle multi-level nesting (compound nodes), edges between nodes of arbitrary nesting levels and varying node sizes. It is the suggested Cytoscape layout for compound graphs, although it also works very well with noncompound graphs.</p>

<h2>Layout Settings</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Select <b>Layout &rarr; Settings....</b> to open the Layout Settings dialog.</li>
<li>To change the settings for a particular algorithm, select it from the <b>Layout Algorithm></b> drop-down. The relevant set of parameters will be displayed.</li>
<li>When changes are complete, click <b>Apply Layout</b> to apply to your network.</li>
</ul><br /><br />
